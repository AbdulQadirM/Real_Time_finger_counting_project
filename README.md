# Real_Time_finger_counting_project
The project uses computer vision techniques to detect and count the number of fingers displayed in front of a webcam. It is implemented using the OpenCV library and a hand landmark module. The program captures real-time video from the webcam, detects the hand in the frame, and identifies the position of fingers based on landmarks. It then overlays an image of the corresponding number of fingers and displays the count on the screen. The project could be named "Real-time Finger Counting Using Computer Vision.
